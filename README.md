### Instructions
Because TIDAL does not have a public api, It's not possible to get the current playing song,
except you connect your account to last.fm .

1.  Make sure you have connected your last fm account with TIDAL.

2.  Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/purpl3F0x/TIDAL-Discord-Rich-Presence-UNOFFICIAL/releases)
(If you want to run the python script by your own you' ll need to create register for an API in last.fm)

3.  Run the .exe, The first time you run the script it will ask you to allow perdition to access last.fm api and enter your username username on the pop-up box.(sometimes doesn't pop on top)

4.  *Optional*: Place the exe in windows start-up folder to start when computer starts.


**The scripts gets the information form last.fm so if you connect last.fm with your phone (or any other device that) and the script is running in your pc it will RPC will still work.**

The program registers an icon on the taskbar, where you can see the song playing and temporary disable *rich presence*.
